Photo: Machine Factory Berthold Hermle AG. . **Gosheim. ** The Berthold Hermle machine factory recorded a pick-up in the third quarter after the slumps in the first half of the year. "The moderate recovery in demand was not only due to spare parts and service business, but also to the new machinery sector," it said in a statement. Against this background, the AG is also raising its forecast for the full year instead of a 50 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year. Last year, sales amounted to 463.1 million euros. . . . Consolidated sales in the first nine months of the current year fell by 36.1 percent year-on-year to EUR 213.6 million. Order intake slumped by 45.5 percent over the nine-month period of 2019 to EUR 177.0 million. Orders on hand fell by 37 percent to EUR 62.6 million between January and September . . . Nevertheless, "due to the high degree of flexibility, it was also possible to achieve a positive operating result and a solid sales margin in the third quarter," according to the Group. Details were not given. . . . All in all, the machine factory is showing itself to be a reassuring presence regarding the future: "The effects of the Corona pandemic will therefore continue to be felt in the coming year." In addition, some customer segments such as aircraft construction are still in deep crisis. . . Hermle was founded in 1938 as a screw factory, since the end of the 1950s, milling machines have been developed and produced. Today, the Group is one of the world's leading manufacturers of machining centers. . . . . . <a href="https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. econo. de%2Faktuelles%2Fartikel%2Fhermle-heben-die-prognose-an-8290%2F" target="-_blank"></a>. . <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. econo. de%2Faktuelles%2F.2F.F.L.a./intent/tweet?url=https%3A%_blank 2F%2F ></a>www. . <a href="http://www. linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. econo. de%2Faktuelles%2Fartikel%2Fhermle-raises-the-forecast-to-8290%2F" target="-_blank"></a>. . <a href="https://www.xing-share.com/app/user?op=share;sc-_p=xing-share;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww. econo. de%2Faktuelles%2Fartikel%2Fhermle-heben-die-prognose-an-8290%2F" target="_blank"></a>. .
