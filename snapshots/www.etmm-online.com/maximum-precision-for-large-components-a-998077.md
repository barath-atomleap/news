5-Axis Machining Maximum precision for large components
-------------------------------------------------------

06.02.2021Editor: Barbara Schulz

To meet the criteria of ever-expanding customer demands, Chiron has now launched its latest machining centre, the 5-axis Chiron DZ22W.

Based upon the proven platform of the existing 16 Series, the DZ22W is said to be ideal for precise, dynamic complete machining of large steel and aluminium components.

Thanks to the moving gantry design, a particularly rigid machine bed and active component cooling, the DZ22W 5-axis achieves a high level of precision even for large components, the company says. Short cycle times are achieved with high axis acceleration, short changeover times and rapid traverse speeds. The integrated workpiece changing device, which enables blanks and finished parts to be loaded and unloaded during machine operation, is said to further increase productivity.

  

From a specification standpoint, the DZ22W 5-axis has a twin-spindle configuration that can simultaneously work at speed in the 620 by 650 by 600 mm X, Y and Z-axes work envelope. Within this spacious envelope, customers can load a maximum component size of 599 mm diameter with a maximum height of 340 mm with a maximum workpiece load of 600 kg.

The machine features a 61kW spindle motor capable of reaching speeds up to 20,000 rpm. This power and speed are complemented by an axis acceleration rate of 10, 10 and 17 m/s2 across the X, Y and Z axes and a rapid feed rate of 75 m/min across the three axes. This astounding speed is built into every aspect of the Chiron 22 Series with a world-leading tool change system that demonstrates chip-to-chip times of just 3.1 seconds.

The two spindles can be specified with a choice of HSK-A63, HSK-A100 or HSK-T63, with each spindle having an individual tool carousel of 77 tools. The two different main spindles can be specified depending on the task - a high-speed spindle for workpieces made from aluminium or aluminium alloys and a high-torque spindle for large tools and hard-to-machine materials. All additional units, such as cooling, hydraulic and extraction systems are integrated into the machine to take up very little space.
